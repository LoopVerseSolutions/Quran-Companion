# Quran Companion Prototype

This directory contains a high-fidelity prototype of the Quran Companion application. The prototype demonstrates the user interface and interaction patterns that would be implemented in the full application.

## Features Demonstrated

- Quran browsing interface
- Search functionality
- Bookmarking system
- Prayer times display
- Settings and preferences

## How to Run the Prototype

1. Make sure you have Node.js installed (v14.0.0 or higher)
2. Navigate to the prototype directory:
   ```
   cd prototype
   ```
3. Start the server:
   ```
   node server.js
   ```
4. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:5000`

## Prototype Pages

- **Home Page** (`index.html`) - Main landing page with Quran browser
- **Search Page** (`search.html`) - Search interface for finding verses
- **Bookmarks Page** (`bookmarks.html`) - User's saved verses
- **Prayer Times Page** (`prayers.html`) - Prayer times and related features

## Notes

This is a static prototype designed to demonstrate the user experience and interface. The actual implementation would include real data from APIs and backend services.

## Next Steps

After reviewing this prototype, the next steps would be:

1. Gather feedback on the user interface and experience
2. Refine the design based on feedback
3. Begin implementation of the actual application with React and Node.js
4. Connect to appropriate APIs for Quran text, audio, and prayer times data
